This module defines a generic web application interface. It is a common
protocol between web servers and web applications.

The overriding design principles here are performance and generality . To
address performance, this library is built on top of the enumerator package.
The advantages of this approach over lazy IO have been debated elsewhere.
However, helper functions like 'responseLBS' allow you to continue using lazy
IO if you so desire.

Generality is achieved by removing many variables commonly found in similar
projects that are not universal to all servers. The goal is that the 'Request'
object contains only data which is meaningful in all circumstances.

A final note: please remember when using this package that, while your
application may compile without a hitch against many different servers, there
are other considerations to be taken when moving to a new backend. For example,
if you transfer from a CGI application to a FastCGI one, you might suddenly
find you have a memory leak. Conversely, a FastCGI application would be
well served to preload all templates from disk when first starting; this
would kill the performance of a CGI application.
